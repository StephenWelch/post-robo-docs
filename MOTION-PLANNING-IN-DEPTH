# Motion Planning

This document will go in-depth into how to drive a robot in a specific, repeatable trajectory and explain the concepts and algorithms needed to do so. It will roughly follow the same arc that my own self-learning did over the course of roughly 7 months from June 2018 to December 2018.

## Trajectories vs. Paths

## Comparison of Techniques

## Basic Trajectory Following

### Velocity Control and Feedforwards

## Odometry

## Simulation
